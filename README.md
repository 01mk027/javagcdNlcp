## Introduction and Purpose
This basic project is developed for Java101 course on <a href="https://patika.dev">patika.dev</a>. Aim of the project to find greatest common divisor and least common product of two numbers which are entered via keyboard. Each transaction can be achieved by using two <i>while</i> loop.<br/>
In first loop, greatest common divisor is found. First, greatest one of two numbers are determined and upper iteration limit of first while loop is determined as greatest. In between range of first for loop, if two of entered numbers are divisible to <i>backwarded</i> iteration, relevant iteration equated to greatest common divisor and loop is terminated.

In second loop, I aimed to find least common product of two numbers. In this case, upper iteration amount of second loop is ```(n1 * n2)```.
If looping iteration is common product of n1 and n2 least common product number is assigned to iteration parameter and loop is also terminated.
